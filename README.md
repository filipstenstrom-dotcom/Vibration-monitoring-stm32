# Vibration-monitoring-stm32
This project develops a measurement and analysis system for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) using an STM32 Nucleo-H753ZI, MEMS accelerometers, and temperature/humidity sensors. It measures the vibration response of a steel plate under different boundary conditions to identify natural frequencies and stiffness changes.
